# Roadmap: GameBuddies Hub

## Overview

Integrate a SkyOffice-style 2D virtual world into the GameBuddies platform. Players navigate as avatars, chat via proximity video, and launch games through arcade cabinet portals. Uses Colyseus for world state (inside GameBuddieGamesServer) and GameBuddiesTemplate for client structure.
